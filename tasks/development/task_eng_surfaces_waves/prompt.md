Analyze carefully the content of this research article.
I want you to provide me a complete stack of Python code that can be run without errors to reproduce the corresponding simulation results displayed in Figure 1 (part a and b) of the article. You have access to the surface distributions in the folder Surfaces/ as .mat files. In the .mat files, the variable names are as follows ("amp", "dt", "eta_t1", "eta_t2", "h", "Lx", "Ly", "nx", "ny", "Ret", "u_star") and eta_t1 and eta_t2 are arrays whereas the other variables are constants. Make sure you plan and reason step by step in collecting all simulations details and parameters before writing the python script. Reproduce the figure as faithfully as possible.
