# Description 
## Difficulty: _Medium_

- This task uses the codebase [`PyBaMM`](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM/tree/develop), which is a battery simulation package in `python`.
- The task relates to understanding the state of health of a battery based on voltage and current data

# Installation

``` python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
where the `requirements.txt` files has been included in this directory

# Warnings

- For now, DO NOT code inside PyBaMM repo. Just generate single main.py file

- **Version Issue**: o3-mini training database will include only understanding of older version of the PyBaMM codebase. But the implementation here requires new version.

# Extra Data Files

No extra data files. The `data/` directory is empty
